# Bar Reference Application

This terminal application will be used to display information about beers, wines, spirits and other alcoholic beverages, that would be stocked in a bar.

A user will be able to add and remove items to the database and retrieve an item's information (alcohol percentage/standard drinks, where it's from, serving size, etc.) using a search function.

The core feature of the app will be to take user input and 'mix' items and retrieve the new combined items information, allowing users to see and create information regarding cocktails.

## Setup and Use

The application does not require any installed packages and functions using builtin packages of python3.

In order to start using the application in your very own bar, open the application and enter in the prompted information. After that, add the first item to your bar and a new directory will be created that contains all the data relevant to your bar.

### Adding items
To add an item, follow these steps:
- Open the application.
- Enter the name of your bar.
- Enter 1 as prompted to begin item adding.
- Enter the type of item you wish to add.
- When prompted enter the requested information.
- Approve adding the item and the item will be saved!

- Once you have at least one item you will be able to create mixes too, using a similar process.

### Searching items
To search for an item:
- Enter the item's name or code (find the code by seeing the item lists)
- If the item exists, all of it's information will be presented.
- Choose to either delete the item or return to the main menu.

### Item list
Otherwise known as 'menus', these show simplified information or either all items or items filtered by type, depending on your input.
